#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I
a) O(n)
    Linear run time, as input size grows, the loop will run longer at a constant rate.


b) O(n^2)
    Loop within a loop, quadratic (polynomial), as input size grows runtime rate increases.  Only good for small inputs, does not scale for very large input.


c) O(n)
    Linear constant rise in run time as input size grows, the runtime grows at a constant rate.

<!-- O(log n)
    Linear constant rise in run time, diminishing input for every recursion.  As input size grows, runtime rate does not increase very quckly. -->
